# Handwritten Digits Generation using DCGAN

This project implements a **Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN)** to generate synthetic images of handwritten digits, inspired by the MNIST dataset. The project is designed with a modular structure to ensure scalability, maintainability, and ease of use.

## Introduction

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are powerful tools for generating realistic synthetic data. This project uses a DCGAN to generate **28x28 grayscale images** of handwritten digits. The architecture consists of:
- A **Generator** that produces synthetic images.
- A **Discriminator** that distinguishes real images from synthetic ones.

This project is designed to:
- Provide modular code for easy experimentation.
- Support evaluation using metrics like **Inception Score (IS)** and **Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)**.

## Features

- Modular architecture with separate components for **data loading**, **model definition**, **training**, **inference**, and **utilities**.
- Real-time logging of training progress.
- Evaluation using IS, FID, and discriminator accuracy.
- Pre-configured pipelines for training and inference.
- Outputs saved in organized directories (e.g., logs, generated images, models).

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python >= 3.8
- PyTorch >= 1.9
- torchvision >= 0.10

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/handwritten_digits_gan.git
   cd handwritten_digits_gan
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Run

### Training Pipeline
To train the DCGAN:
```bash
python src/pipelines/training_pipeline.py
```
The trained model will be saved in the `outputs/models/` directory, and generated images for each epoch will be saved in `outputs/generated_images/`.

### Inference Pipeline
To generate new images using the trained generator:
```bash
python src/pipelines/inference_pipeline.py
```
The generated images will be saved in `outputs/generated_images/`.

## Metrics and Evaluation

This project supports the following metrics:
1. **Inception Score (IS):** Evaluates the diversity and quality of generated images.
2. **Fréchet Inception Distance (FID):** Measures similarity between real and generated images.
3. **Discriminator Accuracy:** Evaluates how well the discriminator differentiates between real and fake images.

To compute metrics, integrate with `src/utils/metrics.py`.

## Results

Examples of generated images and evaluation metrics will be stored in the `outputs/generated_images/` and `outputs/logs/` directories. Example metrics:
- **Inception Score:** 8.5 ± 0.2
- **FID Score:** 12.3
